		<h3 class="me">Project Summary</h3>
		

				
			<p> We identified this project while learning more about the institution, and learning about its problems, and this problem of women still going back to their old ways despite getting help and therapy. This problem affects the mission and the efforts of the institution to save and help women in prostitution.

This also affects women in a way where it will be hard for them to get help and to finally move on from their past actions, so with our project we will try our best to promote these women to get hired for actual jobs in order for them to provide for themselves, with this we can at least help these women to find opportunities even if itâ€™s at least a part-time or a full-time job.

This project will help the women to find new sources of income and get better opportunities than when they try to find a job on their own. Which will also lessen the chance of them coming back to prostitution and continuing it.

		<h3 class="me">Rationale</h3>
		

				
			<p> This project is important for the institution in order for it to get more recognition and it will help the institution in maintaining its mission. It maintains its mission by preventing women who already got help from the institution to continue prostitution and to make them stop permanently by giving them job opportunities where they can work full-time or part-time until they have enough money for themselves, it is also important for the institution to get more recognition so that more women can get more help regarding problems with prostitution.
