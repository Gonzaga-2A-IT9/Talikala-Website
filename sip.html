			<p>Does green manure affect the amount of leaves and height of the basil <i>(Ocimum basilicum)</i> plant over time? 
Based from our reasearch, knowlage and information, The Organic Molecules or Biomolecules present in our research are Carbohydrates<i>(Polysaccharide)</i>, Lipids and Proteins. These organic molecule or biomolecules are resposible in helping with the growth of plants when composting.                                  			</p>

		<h3 class="me">Hypothesis</h3>




<b><p>Based from our observed problem and research, our hypothesis would be If green manrure compost is used to grow the basil 
<i>(Ocimum Basillicum)</i> plant then it will increase its height faster and its amount of leaves will increase. From our research and multiple sources, The two nutrients what would be delivered by the compost to be used in the sip are Nitrogen and  </p></b>

		<h3 class="me">Present Plant Nutrients in Composting</h3>




<p>The nutrients classified and expected in our composting are Phosphorus and Nitrogen. <br>
Phosphorus is a component of plant cells and is necessary for 
cell division and the growth of the plant's growing tip. It is essential for young plants and seedlings because of this. Although they may also take up some types of organic phosphorus, 
the roots mostly take up phosphorus in the form of orthophosphate. Diffusion is how phosphorus gets to the root surface.<br>
Nitrogen is a part of the chlorophyll molecule, which helps plants use photosynthesis to absorb solar energy, promoting plant growth and crop output. To guarantee that energy is accessible when or where the plant needs it to maximise output, nitrogen plays a crucial role within the plant <br> 
Physiological processes like nitrate or ammonium transport through cell membranes in roots, nitrate reduction in roots and leaves, N2 fixation within nodules for legumes and ammonium assimilation regular plants' nitrogen metabolism.</p>

		<h3 class="me">Variables</h3>




<p class="how"><b>Independent Variable</b></p>
<p> 
The independent variable is the green manure compost used to grow the basil <i>(Ocimum basilicum)</i> plant
</p>

<p class="how"><b>Dependent Variable</b></p>
<p> 
The dependent variables are the height and amount of leaves of the basil <i>(Ocimum basilicum)</i> plant 
</p>

<p class="how"><b>Controlled Variable</b></p>
<p> 
The controlled variables are the type of pot that will be used, the type of water that will be used(tap water), amount of water for each plant, amount of soil for each pot, type of seedlings/plant <i>(Basil/Ocimum basilicum)</i>, Amount of seedlings per pot.
